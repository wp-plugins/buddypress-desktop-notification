Send desktop notification to your users

== Description ==
BuddyPress Desktop Notification enables your users to get notified about new messages, new friendships, new acitivities of their friends with \"desktop notification\". Once they sign in, they will be asked by their browser, if they accept desktop notifications. From now on, every few seconds an ajax request will be send asking for news in the network. This can be direct messages, new activity updates of friends, friend requests or accepted friend requests by other users.

Unlike other notification plugins, this one works also when the browser is minimized. The notification will pop up on the bottom left and inform the user. It will automatically disappear after a few seconds.

Not all browsers support desktop notifications. A list of which browser supports this system will be found [here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=notifications).
